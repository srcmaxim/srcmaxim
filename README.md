## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

Thank you for stopping by.    
My name is Maksym Koval.  

I'm a Software Developer based in Kharkiv, Ukraine.  

I do a few things:

* I occasionally [ðŸ“– blog](https://srcmaxim.com)
* And, obviously, push some code to [ðŸ’» Github](https://github.com/srcmaxim)

Here's a neat selection of projects that I enjoyed building:

1. https://github.com/srcmaxim/url-shortener  
Just a URL shortener that you can build, run and test with one line of code (you need docker-compose).  
Build with Quarkus and Kotlin. Uses GraalVM native-image.  
Also, this project is tuned for performance.

2. https://github.com/srcmaxim/gradle-example  
It's a kind of FizzBuzz enterprise edition that gets you a random cat breed.  
Multimodule Gradle project with (SonarQube, CheckStyle), Docker, Kubernetes, Helm Charts, GitHub CI pipeline, and ArgoCD.  
Also every CI/CD step fires an event and I get all updates in the Telegram chanel.  

3. https://github.com/srcmaxim/aws-blog/tree/master/src  
It's a blogging platform for 1 user,  all data is stored in DynamoDB in a denormalized structure.  
Runs both locally with DynamoDB and in AWS. Also, I used Quarkus here.  
Created 2 AWS Code Pipelines for Lambda CI/CD and DynamoDB.  
AWS Lambda uses Quarkus with GraalVM native-image.
